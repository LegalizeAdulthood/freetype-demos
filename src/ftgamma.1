.B ftgamma
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
The
.B ftgamma
demo program opens a window showing series of grey stripes filled with
solid color and checkered pattern of pixels.  Your monitor's gamma value
roughly corresponds to the horizontal position where the solid and checkered
stripes are equally bright when seen from some distance.  Three brightness
targets are explored: 33%, 50%, and 67%.  If the input-output curve of your
monitor does not follow ideal power law relationship, you might observe
slightly different gamma values at different brightness levels.  It is also
possible to examine gamma values for basic colors.
.
.PP
An alternative pattern of slightly slanted anti-aliased lines is provided
to calibrate gamma for uniform perceived thickness of the lines.  The gamma
value that corresponds to vanishing moir√© pattern is ideal for anti-aliased
font rendering.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.
The
.B ftgamma
demo program opens a window showing series of grey stripes filled with
solid color and checkered pattern of pixels.  Your monitor's gamma value
roughly corresponds to the horizontal position where the solid and checkered
stripes are equally bright when seen from some distance. Three brightness
targets are explored: 33%, 50%, and 67%. If the input-output curve of your
monitor does not follow ideal power law relationship, you might observe
slightly different gamma values at different brightness levels.
